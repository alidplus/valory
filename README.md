# Frontend Junior Interview Project
## Instructions
Implement this design which presents the average price of Bitcoin over a selectable time frame.

When you’re finished, submit a PR and assign me as a reviewer.

### notes

- Imagine you’re submitting a PR to a production project you’re working on
- Use the `reduce` function you were implementing in the interview – i.e. don’t use javascript’s built-in reduce function
- The design is light on details intentionally – we encourage you to make clarifications and request changes
- Actual designs in the course of normal work at Valory would be much more fleshed out
- We recommend using Coingecko’s v3 `market_chart` endpoint for Bitcoin’s price
- Do not use any UI frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind or Chakra. JS frameworks are fine.
- Include some notes in the PR to walk me through any choices you needed to make or any feedback you have on the design
- Don’t worry about responsiveness
- Don’t spend more than 4 hours implementing

# Getting Started with Interview Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
